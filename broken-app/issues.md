# Broken App Issues
Missing Error Handling: The original code lacks proper error handling. I added a try-catch block to handle errors and return appropriate responses.
Input Validation: The code now checks if the input is a valid array of developers. It returns a 400 Bad Request response if the input is invalid.
Refactoring: The code has been refactored to use async/await for cleaner asynchronous code. Middleware (body-parser) has been added for parsing JSON bodies.
Rate Limit Concerns: There is no rate limit handling in the code. GitHub has a strict rate limit, and the code might run into issues if it exceeds the limit. Consider implementing a solution to handle this, such as caching or rate limiting
